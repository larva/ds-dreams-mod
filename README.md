## Reusing Code and Artwork; Licenses and Whatnot

I'd be pleased to know how far the code and/or artwork is going -- it's fun to see my work get reused! That's why the mod code itself is, as much as possible, [GPL 2.x+](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#GPLPluginsInNF) and [hosted on github](https://github.com/larva/ds-dreams-mod).

I am also open to incorporating suggested changes back into the mod. Please consider opening a discussion thread or even a github pull request.
